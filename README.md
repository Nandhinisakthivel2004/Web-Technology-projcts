      <p>There once was a boy who grew bored while watching over the village sheep.</p>
      <p>
      <b>He wanted to make things more exciting.</b>
      <i>So, he yelled out that he saw a wolf chasing the sheep.</i> 
      <u>All the villagers came running to drive the wolf away.</u>
      <mark>however, they saw no wolf.</mark>
      <em> The boy was amused, but the villagers were not.</em>
     They told him not to do<sub> it again.</sub> 
     Shortly after, he repeated <sup>this antic.</sup>
     <hr>
    <center>The villagers came running again, only to find that he was lying.</center>
    <hr>
     Later that day, the boy really sees a wolf sneaking amongst<del> the flock.</del>
      He jumped up and <del>called</del> out<ins> for help.</ins>
    <strong>But no one came this time because they thought he was still joking around.</strong>
    <small> At sunset, the villagers looked for the boy.</small>
    <b> He had not returned with their sheep.</b>
    <i> They found him crying. He told them that there really was a wolf, and the entire flock was gone.</i>
    <u> An old man came to comfort him and told him that nobody would believe a <mark> liar </mark> even when they are being honest</u>
